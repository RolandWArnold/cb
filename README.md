# The continuous Bernoulli: fixing a pervasive error in variational autoencoders

This repo contains example code from [The continuous Bernoulli: fixing a pervasive error in variational autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06845). Different likelihoods are in separate notebooks for didactic purposes, cb_vae_mnist.ipynb implements the continuous Bernoulli VAE on MNIST.
